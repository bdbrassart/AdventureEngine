# AdventureEngine

This is just a small "game engine" that could act as a framework for a text based adventure.

I was inspired by MUDs liek Gemstone, DragonRealms, and Aardwolf, and while I realize that I could just go play them instead, I thought it would be fun to try and make a rudimentary "MUD Engine" that you could easily build in your own rooms without much coding.

Maybe eventually you could create a Front End for "dungeon creation" the simplify entry of locations etc...

Primarily it's an excuse to practice python.  I find it a lot easier to learn/play with code if I have an end goal.  I also wanted to get better at understanding classes and other aspects of object oriented programming.
